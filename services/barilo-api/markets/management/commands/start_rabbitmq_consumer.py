# Description: Command to start RabbitMQ Consumer
# Advantages of Using Django Management Commands

# Consistent Environment:
#     Ensures that the Django environment is properly set up, similar to how it is for other management commands.
#     Automatically handles setting up the Django settings and Python path.

# Ease of Use:
#     Run the consumer using a standard Django command: python manage.py run_consumer.
#     Consistent with other Django commands, making it easier for developers to understand and maintain.

# Logging and Debugging:
#     Leverages Django's logging and exception handling mechanisms.
#     Easier to integrate with other Django management tools and scripts.

# Configuration Management:
#     Easier to pass arguments and options to the command using Django's built-in command argument parsing.
